# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Fish-Image-Classification

The goal of this project is to present a case study for automatic fish species classification in underwater image monitoring. The images are taken from coral reefs and rivers. The presented classification scheme in this study is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
